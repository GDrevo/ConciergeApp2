<h1>ConciergeApp<h1>

<h3>A concierge application for tenants who want to book services for their flat.</h3>

This application should allow Users to schedule Appointments with Cleaners, depending on the Cleaners' Availabilities.

For now, I have implemented:
- a homepage following the design guidelines I received
- Authentication for Users and Cleaners, allowing each to have its own UI
- the possibility for Cleaners to set their Availabilities through a weekly calendar
- a simple form allowing a User to choose between different services and choose when he wants it to be done
- a feature made with StimulusJS allowing to fetch only the available cleaners at the chosen time, and display them to the user in a list he can choose from
